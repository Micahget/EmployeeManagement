# This project is a web-based employee management system built using Java Servlets and JSP. The system allows employees to create an account by providing their personal information such as name, email, password, department, and designation. Once registered, they can view their profile, edit their information, and delete their account.


# The application also provides administrators with the ability to manage employee accounts by viewing, editing, and deleting their information. This feature ensures that employee information remains up-to-date and accurate. The system also includes a login and logout functionality, providing secure access to employee accounts.

# The user interface is designed using Bootstrap 3, jQuery, and CSS to provide a modern and 
# user-friendly experience. The system utilizes JDBC and MySQL for database connectivity and management.

# This project provides a practical solution for managing employee information and streamlining the 
# employee onboarding process. It can be used in small and medium-sized businesses to manage employee 
# accounts efficiently. Overall, this system is a valuable tool for HR departments to manage employee 
# accounts securely and effectively.
